            <p>I'm a first-year BSCS student learning about coding and web development. Coding isn't really my passion, but I'm trying my best to learn it. I've always loved photography and expressing myself through pictures. Still, I chose this course to be practical and secure a better future.  </p>
            <p>I'm learning the basics of HTML, and CSS. Itt's challenging and draining, but I stay open to learning. I believe I can still grow in this field with effort and time. Even if it's not my passion, I'm committed to making the most of it.</p>
